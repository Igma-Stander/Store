# Store

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## My Project

In this project I created a stationary store where you can login and register. The prices also add up to give you a total.

## Installation

In the command line interface, you can do the following:

### `npm install`
This installs the project dependencies.

### `npm install --save react-bootstrap bootstrap`
This installs the bootstrap needed for styling.

## Usage

Runs the app in the development mode.
